# LinkedIn-Data-Quality-Automated-Testing-Script
This is a script created by me and maintained during almost 11 months while working for LinkedIn. This Script was used to check the quality of the data (software products data) during publication onto the platform. 

It has been created using pandas to manipulate the data and pygsheets to edit Google Sheets where the data was hosted to mark in color red the errors so that the team members that gathered the data could go over the errors and fix them.
